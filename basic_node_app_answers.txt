1. What is a Node module?
A: A Node module is a set of functions you want to include in your application.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
A: Exports is a reference to module.exports and any reassignment of it
cannot be used outside of the module. Module.exports is an empty object by
default, and it can be reassigned to anything.

3. Why is using exports recommended?
A: It is recommended because it can be used when you don't need a specific
object type. Module.exports should be used when the object type does need to
be specific.
